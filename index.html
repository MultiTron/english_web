                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>
                    London is the capital of England and the United Kingdom and one of the largest and most important
                    cities in the world. The area was originally settled by early hunter gatherers around 6,000 B.C.,
                    and researchers have found evidence of Bronze Age bridges and Iron Age forts near the River Thames.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ancient Romans founded a port and trading settlement called Londinium in 43 A.D., and a few years
                    later a bridge was constructed across the Thames to facilitate commerce and troop movements. But in
                    60 A.D., Celtic queen Boudicca led an army to sack the city, which was burned to the ground in the
                    first of many fires to destroy London.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The city was soon rebuilt, but burned again about 125 A.D. More rebuilding occurred, and within a
                    few generations the population exceeded 40,000 people. After the fall of the Roman Empire in 476
                    A.D., however, the city was attacked numerous times by Vikings and other raiders, and soon London
                    was largely abandoned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The city’s fortunes began to change in 1065, when Westminster Abbey was established. One year later,
                    after his victory at the Battle of Hastings, William the Conqueror was crowned King of England.
                    During his reign, the Tower of London was built, and in 1176 a wooden London Bridge that had
                    repeatedly burned was replaced by a bridge of stone.As the power of the Tudor and the Stuart
                    dynasties grew, London expanded in size and importance. By the time Henry VIII was king, the
                    population of London was at least 100,000.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Real disaster struck in 1665, when London was hit by the Great Plague, which killed about 100,000
                    people. One year later, the city, which had swollen to about a half-million in population, mostly
                    housed in wooden structures, was again reduced to ashes in the Great Fire of London. In the wake of
                    that inferno, many notable buildings were constructed, including Buckingham Palace and St. Paul’s
                    Cathedral.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the reign of Queen Victoria, London was well established as the prestigious seat of the vast
                    British Empire, and while Big Ben rose above the city in 1859, the London Underground opened in 1863
                    as the world’s first subterranean railway.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the Great Smog of 1952, Londoners endured immeasurable suffering and thousands died during
                    and after the pollution event. More recently, a terrorist attack on the London transit system killed
                    56 people in 2005. But the city has continued to grow and prosper, hosting the 2012 Olympics, while
                    establishing itself as the preeminent cultural and financial center of Europe.

                <h2>Culture</h2>
                <p>The culture of London concerns the music, museums, festivals and lifestyle within London. The city is
                    particularly renowned for its theatre quarter British Museum, the Tate Galleries, the National
                    Gallery, the Notting Hill Carnival and The O2.
                </p>
                <h3>Clasical music and opera</h3>
                <p>
                    There are three major concert halls in the capital. One of these is the Barbican Hall at Barbican
                    Centre; which is home to the London Symphony Orchestra and BBC Symphony Orchestra. The Royal
                    Festival Hall, based at the South Bank Centre along with the Queen Elizabeth Hall and the Hayward
                    Gallery is home to the London Philharmonic Orchestra, and the Philharmonia. The final and
                    largest of all venues is the Royal Albert Hall, which hosts the Proms each summer. The Royal
                    Philharmonic Orchestra is also based in London at Cadogan Hall.
                </p>
                <h3>Festivals</h3>
                <p>
                    London hosts several festivals, fairs and carnivals throughout the year with over 40 free festivals
                    each year. The most famous is the Notting Hill Carnival, the world's second largest carnival. The
                    carnival takes place over the August bank holiday weekend, and attracts almost 1 million people.
                    London also hosts the Carnaval Del Pueblo, Europe's greatest Latin American Festival, held on the
                    first Sunday of August each year. Seven countries participate in this street procession, which ends
                    in Burgess Park. Live music, dance, and Funfairs go up to 9:30 pm.
                </p>
                <h3>Art, museums and art galaries</h3>
                <p>
                    The British National collection of Western Art to 1900 is held at The National Gallery. Other major
                    collections of pre-1900 art are The Wallace Collection; the Courtauld Gallery at the Courtauld
                    Institute of Art; and Dulwich Picture Gallery.
                    London is home to over 240 museums, galleries, and other institutions, many of which are free of
                    admission charges and are major tourist attractions as well as playing a research role. The first of
                    these to be established was the British Museum in Bloomsbury, in 1753. Originally containing
                    antiquities, natural history specimens and the national library, the museum now has 7 million
                    artefacts from around the globe. Also of eighteenth-century foundation is the Royal Academy of Arts;
                    its summer exhibition has been an annual fixture on the London social calendar since 1769. In 1824
                    the National Gallery was founded to house the British national collection of Western paintings; this
                    now occupies a prominent position in Trafalgar Square.

                <h2>Things to do</h2>
                <p>No matter your reason for visiting, London has something for everyone.</p>
                <h3>British museum</h3>
                <p>
                    The British Museum is both an architectural beauty and a trove of some of the world's most noted
                    antiquities. In fact, many travelers it's the best museum in all of London. What's more, it's free
                    to visit. From the Rosetta Stone to the Elgin Marbles to the Lindow Man, the British Museum is a
                    history buff's dream containing artifacts in the millions. The immense collection can make an
                    initial museum visit seem overwhelming: Pick the exhibits that most interest you, and plan return
                    trips if you feel so inclined.
                </p>
                <h3>Tower of London</h3>
                <p>
                    Although its exterior might be grim and even unimpressive (especially when compared to stately
                    Buckingham Palace), the Tower of London's interior is always bustling with activity. The tower,
                    which actually comprises multiple towers – 12 of which can be explored by the public – offers
                    something for everyone. If you're enchanted with the history of the monarch, don't miss the famous
                    crown jewels exhibition. Among the items you'll see is the Imperial State Crown – which is still
                    worn by the queen for each State Opening of Parliament – and the Sovereign's Sceptre with Cross. If
                    you have more than an hour to spend here, take an entertaining tour led by the Yeoman Warders (tower
                    guards). During the hour-long excursion (included in your admission ticket), the guards will regale
                    you with tales of the tower's bloody past. Lastly, don't forget to visit the White Tower, an iconic
                    symbol of London's heritage and one of the world's most famous castles. Inside, you'll find the
                    350-year-old exhibition, "Line of Kings," along with artifacts from Henry VIII, Charles I and James
                    II.
                </p>
                <h3>Buckingham Palace</h3>
                <p>
                    Buckingham Palace, the London home of Queen Elizabeth II, is open for tour (except for the queen's
                    private quarters, of course) in the summers and select dates during the winter and spring. On the
                    tour, you'll have access to the 19 State Rooms where the queen and members of the royal family host
                    guests for state, ceremonial and official affairs. Opulently accented with chandeliers, candelabra,
                    paintings by Rembrandt and Rubens, and exquisite English and French furniture, these rooms display
                    some of the most magnificent pieces from the Royal Collection.
                </p>
                <h3>Other Attractions</h3>
                <p>
                    Along with Parliament and Big Ben, Tower Bridge is London's next must-see architectural marvel, not
                    to mention the most famous bridge that crosses the Thames. The Churchill War Rooms are the
                    underground bunker that Prime Minister Winston Churchill and his war cabinet used to shelter from
                    bomb raids and plot their steps during World War II. Besides Westminster Abbey, St. Paul's Cathedral
                    is arguably the second must-see church in London. With its imposing dome, one of the largest in the
                    world, St. Paul's forms a predominant spot along London's skyline.
