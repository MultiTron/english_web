                <h3>Roman London</h3>
                <p>
                    Londinium was established as a civilian town by the Romans about four years after the invasion of
                    the Romes.
                    London, like Rome, was founded on the point of the river where it was narrow enough to bridge and
                    the strategic
                    location of the city provided easy access to much of Europe.During the 2nd century Londinium was at
                    its height and
                    replaced Colchester as the capital of Roman Britain (Britannia).By the 5th century, the Roman Empire
                    was in rapid decline and in AD 410,
                    the Roman occupation of Britannia came to an end. However, they left marks in the form of roads,
                    monuments and other cultural treasure.
                </p>
                <h3>Anglo-Saxon London</h3>
                <p>
                    After the Romans left the island, Britons were uprotected and soon atacked by waves of Germanic
                    tribes known as Angles, Saxons and Jutes.
                    But in a few centuries later the inveders had to protect their lands from being taken over by the
                    Vikings.
